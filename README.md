#The Snake Game
For the final project I chose to create a snake game. The requirements of the game were to have snake movement controlled by keys, food spawning at random positions, snake grows when eating food,collision detecting, score tracking,level system,highscore, start screen and pause functionality. The purpose of this project was to further my understanding and become better at coding. Throughput this prohect I faced many challenges but I was able to overcome them

#How to run the Game
the requirments needed to run the game is VS code downloaded TKinter and python. Inorder to run the game press the play button and then you will be prompted to select a difficulty. once you have selected a difficulty the game will run and you can use the arrows on your keyboard to controll the direction of the snake while trying to eat the food.

#Features
Difficulty selection,snake movement,food and growth system,level progression,pause and resume system,highscore saving system,restart system
